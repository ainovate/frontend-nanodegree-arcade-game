# Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game

#### I love games!!! This is my first time to make a game on my own, even it was a very easy Arcade-Game. I enjoy the whole time.

## Instructions
- It's very easy to use, you can open the html file in most of browsers.
- Just use arrow keys to control the character to move.
- Try to avoid the bugs and get more gems as you can. 
- Have fun!
